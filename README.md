### ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Nikita, this is my repository with examples of my work: bug reports, test cases and checklists. 
Iâ€™m currently learning Python and looking forward to use it in automation.
Also interested in load testing and other types of non-functional testing. Obsessed with learning something new and developing my skills.
